Move JS `<script>` elements to the end of `<body>`.

This can *decrease* the time to
[first render](https://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#js_bottom).

You can pass `filter`, a function called with each checked node, returning
`true` if the script should be moved, and `false` if not.

## Install

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install rehype-javascript-to-bottom
```

## Example

##### In

```html
<!doctype html><html><head><script src="index.js"></script></head><body></body></html>
```

##### Out

```html
<!doctype html><html><head></head><body><script src="index.js"></script></body></html>
```
