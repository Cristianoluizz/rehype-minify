Concatenate CSS `<style>` elements together.

This plugin can be dangerous if CSS is invalid.
Additionally, this plugin does not handle `scoped` styles.
Those are [deprecated](https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/552) anyway.

## Install

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install rehype-concat-css-style
```

## Example

##### In

```html
<style>b{color:red}</style>
<style>i{color:blue}</style>
```

##### Out

```html
<style>b{color:red}i{color:blue}</style>
```
