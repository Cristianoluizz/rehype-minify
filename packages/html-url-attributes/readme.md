## What is this?

This package contains info on attributes that have URLs as values.

## When should I use this?

You can use this package any time you’re rewriting URLs.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install html-url-attributes
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esm-sh]:

```js
import {urlAttributes} from 'https://esm.sh/html-url-attributes@2'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esm-sh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import {urlAttributes} from 'https://esm.sh/html-url-attributes@2?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {urlAttributes} from 'html-url-attributes'

console.log(urlAttributes.formAction)
//=> ['button', 'input']
console.log(urlAttributes.href)
//=> ['a', 'area', 'base', 'link']
```

## API

This package exports the following identifiers:
`urlAttributes`.
There is no default export.

### `urlAttributes`

Map of URL attributes in HTML (`Record<string, Array<string>>`).

## Syntax

HTML is handled according to WHATWG HTML (the living standard), which is also
followed by browsers such as Chrome and Firefox.

## Syntax tree

The syntax tree format used is [`hast`][hast].

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with all maintained
versions of Node.js.
As of now, that is Node.js 12.20+, 14.14+, and 16.0+.
Our projects sometimes work with older versions, but this is not guaranteed.

## Security

As **rehype** works on HTML and improper use of HTML can open you up to a
[cross-site scripting (XSS)][xss] attack, use of rehype can also be unsafe.
Use [`rehype-sanitize`][rehype-sanitize] to make the tree safe.
